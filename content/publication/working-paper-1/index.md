abstract: The environmental regulations can affect the distribution of pollution and thus alter the burden of pollution costs. In South Florida, a wind-based sugarcane burning regulation was put in place to restrict burning when winds were likely to direct pollution towards higher-income and more densely populated areas. In 2019, additional burn restrictions were introduced to mitigate burning on days with poor air quality. Leveraging data from satellite-based active fire products and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) levels, this study empirically assesses the air quality and distributional impacts of the 2019 burning restrictions, using difference-in-differences and triple difference estimations. The analysis reveals that, on restricted days, the number of fires in the primary sugarcane growing region decreases by $41\%$relative to the protected zone. And the results may provide suggestive evidence that farmers strategically shift burnings to non-restricted days. Consequently, on non-restricted days, communities in the sugarcane-burning areas experience deteriorated air quality. These findings shed light on an unexplored implication of stringent regulations alongside the wind-based discriminatory regulation - distributional consequences.

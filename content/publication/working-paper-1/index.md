abstract: Environmental regulations shape the spatial distribution of pollution, influencing the burden on different communities. In South Florida, wind-based sugarcane burning regulations have historically favored wealthier, densely-populated areas by limiting burning during specific wind conditions. In 2019, additional restrictions were introduced to limit burning on days with low air quality.  By using satellite fire data and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data, we assess the impact of these stringent restrictions on burning and air pollution. Results reveal a $41\%$ decrease in burning on restricted days within the main cultivation area, potentially leading to increased burning on days without restrictions. This unintended consequence exacerbates air quality issues for the regionâ€™s most vulnerable populations. The study reveals regulatory enhancements inadvertently worsen environmental inequities, highlighting the need for environmental justice policies that address historical and systemic discrimination affecting pollution distribution.
